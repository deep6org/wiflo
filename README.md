# wiflo : atomicity by design

def'n:

atomicity: State being composed of atoms.
'wi' OR 'we': short for wireless OR wicca. sounds like, "we" as "objective us"
flo(Ï‰): continuity of substance, possibly via a medium.

hypothesis: filecoin represents a model for global efficient data access at a reduction in energy / cost via market primitives for closer to natural outcomes for modelling cognition of agent-environment interaction. travel economy will be replaced by online economy. where becomes who. 

approach : Direct fueling of attention economies contributed via mindful state capture and places of commonness.

question : What might a neuroeconomy look like, with 'auras' as public views?

pitch : contruct local environments (e.g. shared space or communal living) to capture, outputted in 'masked forms' an online view into a mmorpg-like engagement with the use of brain computer interfaces.

data structures of agents have a hierachy of observation resolution (1-5 increase in resolution) dictating that persons contribution reward to a network.
- 1. auras / energy / neurofeedback as wave lengths
- 2. interrelations in field.
- 3. character development + symbols as tokens or descriptors.
- 4. words / journals.
- 5. art / media.

goal : designing systems and protocols for common interaction. 

why ?
- used as social entertainment for alternative participation. e.g. esport audience model
- stake in outcome of generated attention via memes e.g. symbolism / narrative crafting
- possible data input to ecological psychology research
- better modelling of understanding for personal reflection. e.g. personal growth, unconscious, etc.
- longevity, mental health, & immunity research

# trends we see
- Mode: moving physical to virtual environments. where people act on the affordances dictated by designers of a game. people can be who they want to be, within the constraints. 
- Tech: new emerging hardware + software integrations, where tools give higher degrees of freedom and expression.
- Living: alternative modes of living, where we see traditional, localist approaches that is nature integrative. sub-communities, gardens, etc.
- Social: social interest in connection and others.
- Identity: pseduonimity, freedom of speech and political or state targeting.
- Government: Centralized pressures for government state level surveillance from whole being: physical + digital. e.g. sidewalk labs.

# adjacent problems:
Mode: virtual spheres and virtual reality, we go too quick to endpoints that dont necessarily have proper integrations in physical world. this can lead to complete 'escapism'. issues with integration.
Tech: unable to perform small scale testing or iteration
Living: High barrier of entry and coordination costs.
Social: 
Identity: Privacy
Government: Shifting towards self-governance.

Lens / Views:
1. States: Boxed interfaces of value creation. Conceptualized as tiles in internet geography e.g. 2-D map, whereby products and experiences are generated.
2. Auras: Captured essences of bio / meme vibrations. Conceptualized as networked continuous relations e.g. N-D map, whereby emissions of memory and reflections are stored.
3. Presence: Use of accessed gateway (powergate) to interact with storage market (Filecoin) to capture data in cooperative like-minded interactions in a social network e.g. categories of modes: meditation, reading, fitness, spirituality.

Problem : Redistribute & mix value in privacy in health & social networks. 

Question : What might a neuroeconomy look like, with 'auras' as public views?

Hypothesis : biohacking as lifestyle readujustments to tribe finding. travel economy will be replaced by genetic economy. where becomes who. 

Approach : Direct fueling of attention economies contributed via mindful state capture and places of commonness.

Futures : Designing architecture and conversation for the future of catastrophe survival in cooperative, plural, private, & distributed accessible manner. Cities connected at an holographic atomic level, rather than architectural.


# Concrete
short term : areas of focus
- focus on data structure and powergate interfacing 
- gated minimal ui accessible via subscription
- simple data processing


possible directions

* conversational gpt-3: connecting static sites that chat with ideas that emerge as conversations and arguments. https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1283411100331995137?s=20
* lists: storing lists of things for purchase. cross site amazon.
* data streams: streams of health / bci data. sharing based on common categories.

learning goals: front end adding to filecoin network via powergate as threads, deployed on unstoppable domains, central data processing with some visualization aggregation.
