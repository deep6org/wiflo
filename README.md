# wiflo : atomicity by design

atomicity: State being composed of atoms.

'wi' OR 'we': short for wireless OR wicca. sounds like, "we" as "objective us"

flo(Ï‰): continuity of substance, possibly via a medium.

cancel culture antidotes: memory mechanisms for persistence & grouping of memes across spatially localized computation.

hypothesis: filecoin represents a model for global data access at a reduction in energy / cost via market primitives for closer to natural outcomes.

Lens / Views:
1. States: Boxed interfaces of value creation. Conceptualized as tiles in internet geography e.g. 2-D map, whereby products and experiences are generated.
2. Auras: Captured essences of bio / meme vibrations. Conceptualized as networked continuous relations e.g. N-D map, whereby emissions of memory and reflections are stored.
3. Presence: Use of accessed gateway (powergate) to interact with storage market (Filecoin) to capture date in cooperative like-minded interactions in a social network e.g. categories of modes: meditation, reading, fitness, spirituality.

Problem : Redistribute & mix value in privacy in health & social networks. 

Question : What might a neuroeconomy look like, with 'auras' as public views.

Hypothesis : biohacking as lifestyle readujustments to tribe finding. travel economy will be replaced by genetic economy. where becomes who. 

Approach : Direct fueling of attention economies contributed via mindful state capture and places of commonness. Knowledge economies contributing to pending existentialist catastrophes, and preventing faulties in equlibriums in unity.  https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/us/politics/trump-cdc-coronavirus.html

Futures : Designing architecture and conversation for the future of catastrophe survival in cooperative, plural, private, & distributed accessible manner. Cities connected at an holographic atomic level, rather than architectural.


# Concrete

possible directions

* conversational gpt-3: connecting static sites that chat with ideas that emerge as conversations and arguments. https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1283411100331995137?s=20
* lists: storing lists of things for purchase. cross site amazon.
* data streams: streams of health / bci data. sharing based on common categories.

learning goals: front end adding to filecoin network via powergate as threads, deployed on unstoppable domains, central data processing with some visualization aggregation.
